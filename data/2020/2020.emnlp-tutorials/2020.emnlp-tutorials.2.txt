Reading List

We recommend several surveys. 

Shu et al. (2017), which adopted a data mining perspective on “fake news” and focused on social media. 
Another survey (Zubiaga et al., 2018a) focused on rumor detection in social media. 
The survey by Thorneand Vlachos (2018) took a fact-checking perspective on “fake news” and related problems. 
The survey by Li et al. (2016) covering truth discovery in general. 
Lazer et al. (2018) offers a general overview and discussion on the science of “fake news”, while Vosoughi et al. (2018) focuses on the process of proliferation of true and false news online. Other recent surveys focus onstance detection (K¨uc¸ ¨uk and Can, 2020), on propaganda (Da San Martino et al., 2020b), on social bots (Ferrara et al., 2016), on false information (Zannettou et al., 2019b) and on bias on the Web (Baeza-Yates, 2018).
