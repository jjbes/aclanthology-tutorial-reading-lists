Reading list

The core approaches to machine reading comprehension and several widely-used datasets are covered in the survey by Qui et al. (2019). 
For NLI, we refer the reader to the surveys on resources and approaches (Storks et al., 2019b), as well as issues with the current data (Schlegel et al., 2020). 
A survey on benchmarks and approaches is also available for commonsense reasoning (Storks et al., 2019a).
