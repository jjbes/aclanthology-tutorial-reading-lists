Reading list

The following are recommended to read before the tutorial, as they provide background and frame the
context in which the tutorial materials lie:

1. Chapter 3 of Dixon (2005) contains an introduction to some basic concepts in semantics on which UCCA is based.
2. Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016) present a transition-based parser using an architecture on which TUPA, the first UCCA parser, is based (Hershcovich et al., 2017).
3. Peng et al. (2017) performed multi-task learning for meaning representation parsing, inspiring work on cross-framework parsing for UCCA (Hershcovich et al., 2018).
4. Abend and Rappoport (2017) compare and constrast several meaning representations according to various aspects.
5. Deng and Xue (2017) investigate translation divergences using a hierarchical alignment, and discuss bridging them with cross-lingual semantic representations.
6. Croft et al. (2017) list typologically-informed design criteria for Universal Dependencies (Nivre et al., 2020), which are also relevant for other structural representations in NLP.
