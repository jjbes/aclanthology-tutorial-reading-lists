Reading List

We recommend the following short readings to get a sense of the kinds of issues we will be approaching:

• Dual Use: Ehni 2008
• Bias: Speer 2017a
• Privacy: Coavoux et al. 2018 

In addition, we recommend the following papers for a sense of what can be learned from other fields:

• Value scenarios, a technique from value sensitive design: Nathan et al. 2007
• A history of notions of fairness in education and hiring: Hutchinson and Mitchell 2019
• Disparate impact: Feldman et al. 2015 

Participants are encouraged to have read at least
some of these papers ahead of time, but familiarity
with all of them will not be assumed.
