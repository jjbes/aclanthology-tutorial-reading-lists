Reading List

We recommend reviewing the 2015 NAACL tutorial on crowdsourcing.
While we focus on unconstrained and complex case studies, the 2015 tutorial provides an overview of basic terms and methods that is a complementary background to our material. 
However, we review the required material in the background section, and do not assume a familiarity with the content of this prior tutorial. We also recommend reading the main papers describing each of the case studies 

(Williams et al., 2018;
Suhr et al., 2017, 2019b,a; 
Choi et al., 2018; 
Sap et al., 2019b).
