Reading List

We aim to make the tutorial self-contained. 
For trainees interested in reading important studies before the tutorial, we recommend the following papers regarding
 
GNNs (Kipf and Welling, 2016; Li et al., 2015; Hamilton et al., 2017), 
automatic graph construction for NLP (Bastings et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020b,a), 
joint text and knowledge representation learning (Feng et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020), 
modeling directed graphs (Xu et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020b) 
and heterogeneous graphs (Bastings et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020c), 
and GNN based encoder-decoder models (Xu et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020b; Li et al., 2020).
