Specification of the Tutorial

The proposed tutorial is considered a cutting-edge tutorial that introduces the recent ad-vances in an emerging area of NLP. 
The presented topic has not been covered by previousACL/EMNLP/NAACL/EACL/COLING tutorialsin the past 4 years. 
This tutorial has not been pre-sented elsewhere, while a more AI-flavored version with a subset of the contents has been planned in parallel at AAAI 2021, to be presented by a sub-set of the instructors. 
We estimate that at least 60% of the works covered in this tutorial are from researchers other than the instructors. 

Audience and Prerequisites 
While no specific background knowledge is assumed of the audience, it would be best for the attendees to know about basic deep learning technologies, pre-trained wordembeddings (e.g. Word2Vec) and language models(e.g. BERT). The following is a reading list that could help provide background knowledge to the audience before attending this tutorial:
