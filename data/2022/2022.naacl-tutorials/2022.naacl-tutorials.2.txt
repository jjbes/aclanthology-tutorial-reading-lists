Attendee prerequisites and reading list

We will introduce every speech and language task discussed in the tutorial and require no domain knowledge about these tasks from attendees. Instead, the attendees should understand derivatives as found in introductory Calculus, possess basic knowledge in machine learning concepts such as classification, model optimization, gradient descent, pre-training, and Transformer. We also encourage the audience to read the papers of some well-known SSL techniques before the tutorial, which are listed below: 

(Ericsson et al., 2021;
Rogers et al., 2020; 
Liu et al., 2021c; 
Qiu et al., 2020). 

Those papers focus on CV or NLP, so the content does not highly overlap with the tutorial, but the audience can learn more from the tutorial if they already have general ideas about SSL.
