Reading List

We briefly describe recommended reading for participants in this section.

5.1 General Background
Heaven (2020) (link) provides an overview of the replicability/reproducibility crisis in AI, not ing common barriers, potential solutions and their drawbacks. 
Interested readers can also refer to (Baker, 2016) for a general discussion of the replicability/reproducibility crises in science.

5.2 NLP
We recommend participants read the following papers about reproducibility in NLP: 
(Mieskes et al.,2019; Belz et al., 2021a).

5.3 Teaching Reproducibility
Yildiz et al. (2021) introduce a portal2, focusing on teaching AI/ML through ‘low-barrier’ reproducibility projects. They show that this can help develop critical thinking skills w.r.t. research, and that participants placed more value on scientific reproductions.
