The tutorial is targeted toward NLP researchers and practitioners working with humans. The prerequisite includes familiarity with basic knowledge of NLP and language systems. Knowledge of system deployment is a plus. We will also provide a more paced introduction to some materials. Here are a few papers that lay a foundation for this area:

• Re-examining Whether, Why, and How Human-AI Interaction Is Uniquely Difficult to Design (Yang et al., 2020);
• Does the whole exceed its parts? The effect of AI explanations on complementary team performance (Wu & Bansal et al., 2021);
• Principles of mixed-initiative user interfaces (Horvitz, 1999);
• Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction (Amershi et al., 2019);
• Supporting Peer Counselors via AI-Empowered Practice and Feedback (Hsu et al., 2023)
• Evaluating human-language model interaction (Lee et al., 2022b)
