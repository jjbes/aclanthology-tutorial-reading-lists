Prerequisites & Reading List

The tutorial is targeted toward NLP researchers and practitioners working with humans. The prerequisite includes familiarity with basic knowledge of NLP and language systems. Knowledge of system deployment is a plus. We will also provide a more paced introduction to some materials.
The authors will also release an NLP+HCI playbook as a resource for people interested in getting started in human-centered NLP research. Here are a few papers that lay a foundation for this area:

• Putting Humans in the Natural Language Processing Loop: A Survey (Wang et al., 2021);
• All That’s Human Is Not Gold: Evaluating Human Evaluation of Generated Text (Clark et al., 2021);
• Re-examining Whether, Why, and How Human-AI Interaction Is Uniquely Difficult to Design (Yang et al., 2020);
• Does the whole exceed its parts? The effect of AI explanations on complementary team performance (Wu & Bansal et al., 2021);
• Principles of mixed-initiative user interfaces (Horvitz, 1999);
• Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction (Amershi et al., 2019);
• Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022);
• Learning to summarize with human feedback (Stiennon et al., 2020)
