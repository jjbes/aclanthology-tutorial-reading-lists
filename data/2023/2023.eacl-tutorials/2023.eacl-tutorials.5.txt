Reading List: 

The tutorial will be self-contained,
so there is no required reading list. For a preview
of the techniques we will cover, the audience is
welcomed to refer to survey papers such as 

(Feurer and Hutter, 2019; Elsken et al., 2019).

We gave a similar tutorial titled "AutoML for
Machine Translation" at AMTA 2022, a machine
translation conference. The tutorial slides are avail-
able3. For the EACL tutorial, we will add discus-
sion on recent uses of AutoML in various NLP ap-
plications, ranging from text classification to large
language models.
