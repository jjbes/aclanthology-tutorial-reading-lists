Readings

We will cover a diversity of primary research on
ethics, sourced beyond the presenters’ own works,
in the plenary sessions of the tutorial. Also, due to
the abbreviated length of the 1/2-day format, our
tutorial will cross reference sources from the list,
rather than specifically require participants to do
readings before the tutorial.
A full reading list of over 200 works has been
cross-compiled by the full ACL Ethics Commit-
tee, sourced from university courses on NLP Ethics
and related topics. The list available on Github.
The list can be updated by pull requests and is
sortable by both topic and publication type. Topics
