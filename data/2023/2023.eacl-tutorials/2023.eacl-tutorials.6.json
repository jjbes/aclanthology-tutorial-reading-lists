        "abstract": "This cutting-edge tutorial will help the NLP community to get familiar with current research in privacy-preserving methods. We will cover topics as diverse as membership inference, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, or federated learning, all with typical applications to NLP. The goal is not only to draw the interest of the broader community, but also to present some typical use-cases and potential pitfalls in applying privacy-preserving methods to human language technologies.",
