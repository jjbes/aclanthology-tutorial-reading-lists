        "abstract": "Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is an emerging field that has potential to impact how we build models in NLP. As an umbrella term that includes topics like hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search, AutoML has recently become mainstream at major conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR. What does this mean to NLP? Currently, models are often built in an ad hoc process: we might borrow default hyperparameters from previous work and try a few variant architectures, but it is never guaranteed that final trained model is optimal. Automation can introduce rigor in this model-building process. This tutorial will summarize the main AutoML techniques and illustrate how to apply them to improve the NLP model-building process.",
