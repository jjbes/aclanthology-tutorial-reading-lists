Creating a reading list of articles on how socio-cultural perspectives influence annotation in NLP is a great way to explore the intersection of social sciences and technology. While I can't provide articles published after October 2023, I can suggest a list of influential and relevant articles up to that point. Hereâ€™s a list that should give you a comprehensive understanding of the topic:
