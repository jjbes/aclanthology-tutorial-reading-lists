   - Zhang, Tianxing, et al. "Generating informative and diverse conversational responses via adversarial information maximization." *NeurIPS* (2018).
   - Ippolito, Daphne, et al. "Automatic detection of generated text is easiest when humans are fooled." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.00650* (2019).

2. **Non-Factuality of Generated Text:**
   - Maynez, Joshua, et al. "On faithfulness and factuality in abstractive summarization." *Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics* (2020).
   - Kryscinski, Wojciech, et al. "Evaluating the factual consistency of abstractive text summarization." *Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)* (2020).
   - Goodrich, Ben, et al. "Assessing the factual accuracy of generated text." *Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining* (2019).

3. **Evaluation Metrics in NLG:**
