Creating a reading list of articles on human-AI interaction, specifically focusing on large language models (LLMs), involves selecting a mix of academic papers, industry reports, and insightful articles. Hereâ€™s a list of 20 articles and papers that you might find useful. Note that while I can suggest articles up to 2023, I can't provide articles from 2024 as my training data only goes up to October 2023. However, these resources should give you a comprehensive understanding of the topic:

1. **"Attention is All You Need"** by Vaswani et al. (2017) - This foundational paper introduces the Transformer model, which is the basis for many LLMs.

2. **"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding"** by Devlin et al. (2018) - Discusses BERT, a significant advancement in LLMs.
