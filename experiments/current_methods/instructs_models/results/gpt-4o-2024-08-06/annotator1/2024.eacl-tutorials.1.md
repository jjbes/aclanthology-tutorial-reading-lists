Creating a reading list on the computational modeling of semantic change involves selecting articles that cover various aspects of the topic, including methodologies, case studies, and theoretical insights. Here is a list of 20 articles that you might find useful. Note that while I can suggest articles up to 2023, I cannot provide articles from 2024 as my training data only goes up to October 2023.
