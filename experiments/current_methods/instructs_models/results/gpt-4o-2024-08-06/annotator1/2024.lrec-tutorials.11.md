Creating a reading list on the topic of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) involves selecting articles that cover various aspects of this phenomenon, including its causes, implications, and potential solutions. Here is a list of articles and papers that you might find useful. Note that while I can suggest articles up to my last update in October 2023, I can't provide articles from 2024. However, I can suggest some foundational and recent works that are likely to be relevant:
