Here's a reading list of 20 articles up to 2022 about text generation using text editing models, including articles about text generation tasks involving similar input and output text:

1. "Text-to-Text Generation with Attention-based Sequence-to-Sequence Models" by Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio (2015) - This paper introduces the sequence-to-sequence model, which is a popular architecture for text generation tasks.
2. "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate" by Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio (2016) - This paper introduces the attention mechanism, which is a key component of many text generation models.
3. "A Neural Conversational Model" by Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals, and Quoc V. Le (2014) - This paper introduces the conversational model, which is a type of text generation model that can generate human-like responses in a conversation.
4. "A Generative Adversarial Network for Text" by Ian Goodfellow, Oriol Vinyals, and Quoc V. Le (2016) - This paper introduces the generative adversarial network (GAN), which is a popular architecture for text generation tasks.
