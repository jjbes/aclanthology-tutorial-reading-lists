Here's a reading list of 20 articles up to 2022 about text-editing models as seq2seq alternatives for text generation. These articles discuss various approaches to text generation, including seq2seq models, and their applications in various domains.

1. "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" by Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals, and Quoc V. Le. This seminal paper introduced the seq2seq model and its application to machine translation.
2. "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate" by Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. This paper extends the seq2seq model to joint alignment and translation, improving the quality of generated text.
3. "A Neural Conversation Model: Learning to Generate Conversations" by Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. This paper introduces a seq2seq model for conversational systems, where the model generates responses based on the previous input.
4. "Neural Text Generation with Attention" by Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. This paper introduces the attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when generating text.
5. "Neural Text Summarization" by Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. This paper presents a seq2seq model for text summarization, where the model generates a summary of a given text.
