These articles cover a range of topics related to the computational modeling of semantic change, including the definition and measurement of semantic change, computational methods for studying semantic change, and the use of computational models to study semantic change in lexical fields. They provide a valuable resource for researchers and students interested in the field of computational semantics and the study of semantic change.<|endoftext|>
