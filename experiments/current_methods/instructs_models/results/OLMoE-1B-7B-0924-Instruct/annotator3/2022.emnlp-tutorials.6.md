Here's a reading list of 20 articles on non-autoregressive (NAR) sequence generation up to 2022. These articles cover various aspects of NAR models, their applications, and their limitations.

1. "Non-autoregressive Sequence Generation" by SÃ¸gaard and Goldberg (2016) - This paper introduces the concept of non-autoregressive sequence generation and discusses its potential benefits compared to autoregressive models.
2. "Sequence-to-Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" by Sutskever et al. (2014) - This seminal paper on sequence-to-sequence learning, which forms the basis for many NAR models, is still relevant today.
3. "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate" by Dzmitry Bahdanau et al. (2015) - This paper introduces the attention mechanism, which has become a key component in many NAR models.
