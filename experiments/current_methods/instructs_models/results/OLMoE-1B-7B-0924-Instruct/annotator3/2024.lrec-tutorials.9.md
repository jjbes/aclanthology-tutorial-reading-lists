Here's a reading list of 20 articles on the analysis and control of text embedding representations up to 2024. These articles cover various aspects of text embedding representations, including their analysis, control, and applications.

1. "Towards Understanding Word Embeddings" by Mikolov et al. (2013) - This seminal paper introduced word embeddings and laid the foundation for subsequent research in the field.
2. "Effective Approaches to Text Classification" by Lample et al. (2016) - This paper presents a neural network architecture, called "End-to-End Neural Network for Text Classification," that achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.
3. "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding" by Devlin et al. (2018) - This paper introduces BERT, a powerful pre-trained language model that achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide range of natural language processing tasks.
4. "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017) - This paper introduces the Transformer architecture, which revolutionized the field of natural language processing and has since been widely adopted in various applications.
