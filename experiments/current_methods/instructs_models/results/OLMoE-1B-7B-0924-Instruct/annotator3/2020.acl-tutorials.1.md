Here's a reading list of 20 articles up to 2020 on interpretability and analysis of neural network models in NLP. These articles cover various aspects of interpretability and analysis, including visualization, saliency maps, and model interpretability techniques.

1. "Visualizing and Understanding Neural Networks" by Matthew Zeiler and Christian Szegedy. This classic paper introduces the concept of saliency maps and provides a method for visualizing the importance of features in neural networks.
2. "DeepLIFT: Deep Layer-wise Relevance Propagation for Neural Networks" by Shrikumar, Ghorbani, and Shavit. This paper introduces DeepLIFT, a method for interpreting neural networks that assigns relevance scores to input features based on their contribution to the output.
3. "LIME: Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations" by Ribeiro, M. Z. et al. This paper introduces LIME, a method for interpreting individual predictions of black-box models by generating explanations that are interpretable and faithful to the model.
