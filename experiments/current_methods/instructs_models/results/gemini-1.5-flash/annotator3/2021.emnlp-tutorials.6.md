## Reading List: Syntax in End-to-End Models for SRL and MT (up to 2021)

This list focuses on articles exploring the use of syntax in end-to-end models for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) and Machine Translation (MT). It includes both works that explicitly incorporate syntactic information and those that implicitly leverage it through model architecture or training data.

**Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)**

1. **"End-to-End Neural Semantic Role Labeling" by Zhou et al. (2016)**: Introduces an end-to-end neural model for SRL, demonstrating the effectiveness of using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for this task.
2. **"Jointly Learning to Align and Label: Deep Neural Networks for Semantic Role Labeling" by He et al. (2017)**: Proposes a joint model that learns to align words and their semantic roles simultaneously, improving SRL performance.
3. **"Syntax-Aware Neural Semantic Role Labeling" by Zhang et al. (2017)**: Incorporates syntactic information into a neural SRL model by using dependency parsing to guide the prediction of semantic roles.
4. **"A Syntax-Enhanced Neural Network for Semantic Role Labeling" by Liu et al. (2018)**: Explores the use of a graph convolutional network (GCN) to encode syntactic dependencies and improve SRL performance.
5. **"BERT-Based Semantic Role Labeling with Syntactic Information" by Li et al. (2020)**: Demonstrates the effectiveness of using BERT, a pre-trained language model, for SRL and further enhances it by incorporating syntactic features.
6. **"Syntax-Guided Semantic Role Labeling with Graph Neural Networks" by Wang et al. (2021)**: Proposes a novel GCN-based model that leverages syntactic information to improve SRL performance, particularly for complex sentences.

**Machine Translation (MT)**

7. **"Neural Machine Translation with Syntax-Aware Encoder-Decoder" by Luong et al. (2016)**: Introduces a syntax-aware encoder-decoder architecture for MT, using dependency parsing to guide the translation process.
8. **"Syntax-Based Neural Machine Translation" by Shen et al. (2016)**: Explores the use of syntactic information in the form of dependency trees to improve MT performance.
9. **"Jointly Learning to Align and Translate with Recurrent Neural Networks" by Bahdanau et al. (2014)**: Introduces the concept of attention mechanisms in neural MT, implicitly leveraging syntactic information through alignment.
10. **"Attention-Based Neural Machine Translation" by Luong et al. (2015)**: Further develops attention mechanisms, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing syntactic dependencies for MT.
11. **"Transformer: Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017)**: Introduces the Transformer architecture, which relies solely on attention mechanisms and implicitly captures syntactic information through self-attention.
12. **"Syntax-Aware Transformer for Neural Machine Translation" by Gu et al. (2019)**: Proposes a syntax-aware Transformer model that incorporates syntactic information into the attention mechanism, improving MT performance.
13. **"Improving Neural Machine Translation with Syntactic Features" by Li et al. (2020)**: Explores the use of various syntactic features, including dependency parsing and part-of-speech tagging, to enhance MT performance.
14. **"Syntax-Guided Neural Machine Translation with Graph Neural Networks" by Zhang et al. (2021)**: Introduces a GCN-based model that leverages syntactic information to improve MT performance, particularly for long and complex sentences.
