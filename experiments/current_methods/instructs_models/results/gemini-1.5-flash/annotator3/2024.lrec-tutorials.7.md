I cannot provide you with a reading list of 20 articles specifically on DBpedia Databus published up to 2024. Here's why:

* **DBpedia Databus is a relatively new concept:** While DBpedia has been around for a while, the Databus initiative is a more recent development. There might not be a large volume of dedicated articles published before 2024.
* **Limited access to specific publication data:** I do not have access to real-time information about published articles, including those on specific topics like DBpedia Databus. 
* **Dynamic research landscape:** The field of knowledge graphs and data integration is constantly evolving. New research and publications emerge regularly.

**How to find relevant articles:**

1. **Search Scholarly Databases:** Use databases like Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus. Use keywords like "DBpedia Databus," "DBpedia knowledge graph," "linked data," "data integration," and "semantic web."
2. **Check DBpedia Documentation:** The official DBpedia website and documentation might have links to relevant publications or research papers.
3. **Explore Conference Proceedings:** Look for papers presented at conferences related to semantic web, knowledge graphs, and data management.
4. **Follow Researchers and Organizations:** Follow researchers and organizations working on DBpedia and related projects on social media and research platforms. They often share their publications and updates.

Remember to filter your search results by publication date to find articles published before 2024. 

I hope this helps you find the information you need!
