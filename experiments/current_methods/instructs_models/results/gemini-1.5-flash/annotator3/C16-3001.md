## Compositional Distributional Models of Meaning (CDMs) Reading List (up to 2016)

This list provides a selection of influential articles on CDMs, focusing on the period up to 2016. It covers foundational works, key developments, and applications in various areas.

**Foundational Works:**

1. **"Distributional Similarity and the Lexicon" by Mitchell P. Marcus (1998):** This paper introduces the concept of distributional similarity and its potential for representing word meaning.
2. **"A Distributional Hypothesis" by Steven Pinker (1994):** This article argues that word meaning is grounded in the contexts in which words appear, laying the groundwork for distributional semantics.
3. **"The Vector Space Model and the Representation of Word Meaning" by Peter D. Turney (2001):** This paper explores the use of vector space models for representing word meaning based on distributional information.
4. **"Distributional Semantics" by John Barnden (2008):** This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of distributional semantics, covering its history, methods, and applications.
5. **"Word Embeddings: A Survey" by Tomas Mikolov et al. (2013):** This paper reviews various word embedding techniques, including those based on distributional information.

**Key Developments:**

6. **"GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation" by Jeffrey Pennington et al. (2014):** This paper introduces GloVe, a popular word embedding model that leverages global word co-occurrence statistics.
7. **"Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space" by Tomas Mikolov et al. (2013):** This paper presents Word2Vec, another influential word embedding model based on neural networks.
8. **"Compositional Distributional Semantics" by Graeme Hirst (2010):** This paper provides a detailed overview of compositional distributional semantics, focusing on methods for combining word meanings to represent phrase and sentence meanings.
9. **"A Compositional Distributional Model of Semantics" by Marco Baroni and Alessandro Lenci (2010):** This paper proposes a specific compositional model for combining word vectors to represent phrase meanings.
10. **"A Survey of Compositional Distributional Semantic Models" by Marco Baroni et al. (2014):** This paper provides a comprehensive survey of different compositional distributional models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

**Applications:**

11. **"Distributional Semantics and Compositionality" by Graeme Hirst (2015):** This paper explores the use of distributional semantics for understanding compositional meaning in natural language.
12. **"Distributional Semantics for Textual Entailment" by Marco Baroni et al. (2012):** This paper demonstrates the application of distributional semantics for textual entailment tasks.
13. **"Distributional Semantics for Question Answering" by Alessandro Lenci et al. (2012):** This paper explores the use of distributional semantics for question answering systems.
14. **"Distributional Semantics for Sentiment Analysis" by Saif Mohammad (2012):** This paper investigates the application of distributional semantics for sentiment analysis tasks.
15. **"Distributional Semantics for Machine Translation" by Philipp Koehn (2010):** This paper explores the use of distributional semantics for improving machine translation systems.

**Further Exploration:**

16. **"The Distributional Hypothesis" by John Barnden (2008):** This chapter provides a detailed discussion of the distributional hypothesis and its implications for understanding language.
17. **"Distributional Semantics: A Review" by Peter D. Turney and Patrick Pantel (2010):** This paper provides a comprehensive review of distributional semantics, covering its history, methods, and applications.
18. **"Compositional Distributional Semantics: An Introduction" by Marco Baroni and Alessandro Lenci (2011):** This paper provides a concise introduction to compositional distributional semantics, focusing on its key concepts and methods.
