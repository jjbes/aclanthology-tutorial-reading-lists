I cannot provide you with a list of 20 specific articles on the impact of cross-cultural differences on data annotation in language technologies published up to 2024. This is because:

* **I do not have access to real-time information, including published articles.** My knowledge is based on the data I was trained on, which has a cutoff date. 
* **Finding specific articles on a niche topic like this requires a specialized search.** You would need to use academic databases like JSTOR, Google Scholar, or specific language technology journals to find relevant articles.

**However, I can give you some guidance on how to find these articles:**

1. **Use relevant keywords:**  Start with keywords like "cross-cultural differences," "data annotation," "language technologies," "natural language processing," "machine translation," "bias in AI," "cultural bias," and "linguistic diversity."
2. **Search in academic databases:** Use databases like JSTOR, Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore.
3. **Look for specific journals:**  Search for articles in journals like "Computational Linguistics," "Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics," "Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research," and "Natural Language Engineering."
4. **Use conference proceedings:**  Check proceedings from conferences like ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics), EMNLP (Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing), and NAACL (North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics).
5. **Look for relevant research groups:**  Many universities and research institutions have groups working on language technologies and cross-cultural issues. Check their websites for publications.

**Here are some additional tips:**

* **Be specific with your search terms:**  For example, instead of just "cross-cultural differences," try "cross-cultural differences in sentiment analysis" or "cross-cultural differences in machine translation."
* **Use Boolean operators:**  Use "AND," "OR," and "NOT" to refine your search.
* **Filter by publication date:**  Set a date range to find articles published up to 2024.

By following these steps, you should be able to find a comprehensive list of articles on the impact of cross-cultural differences on data annotation in language technologies.
