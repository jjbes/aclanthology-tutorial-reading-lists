**Causal Discovery:**

6. **"Causal Discovery with Continuous Additive Noise Models" by Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, and Richard Scheines (2000)**: Introduces the PC algorithm, a widely used method for causal discovery from observational data.
7. **"A Constraint-Based Approach to Causal Discovery" by Peter Spirtes, Clark Glymour, and Richard Scheines (2000)**: Provides a theoretical framework for causal discovery based on conditional independence relationships.
8. **"Causal Inference by Using Independent Component Analysis" by Patrik Hoyer, Dominik Janzing, Joris Mooij, Jonas Peters, and Bernhard Schölkopf (2009)**: Explores the use of independent component analysis for causal discovery.
9. **"Causal Inference and the Data-Fusion Problem" by Judea Pearl (2000)**: Discusses the challenges and opportunities of causal discovery in the context of data fusion.
10. **"Causal Discovery from Time Series Data" by Kun Zhang, Jonas Peters, Dominik Janzing, and Bernhard Schölkopf (2017)**: Explores methods for causal discovery from time series data, considering temporal dependencies.

**Causal Effect Estimation:**

11. **"Estimating Causal Effects: A Bayesian Perspective" by Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill (2006)**: Introduces Bayesian methods for causal effect estimation, emphasizing the importance of prior information.
12. **"Propensity Score Matching: A Nonparametric Method for Estimating Causal Effects" by Paul Rosenbaum and Donald Rubin (1983)**: Introduces propensity score matching as a method for controlling for confounding variables in observational studies.
