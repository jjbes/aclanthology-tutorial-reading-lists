3. **"Word Space" by Scott Deerwester, Susan T. Dumais, Thomas K. Landauer, George W. Furnas, and Richard A. Harshman (1990)**: Introduces the concept of word space, a vector space representation of words based on their co-occurrence patterns.
4. **"Latent Semantic Analysis" by Thomas K. Landauer and Susan T. Dumais (1997)**: Presents Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a technique for extracting semantic relationships from text.
5. **"The Distributional Hypothesis" by Steven Pinker (1994)**: Argues that word meaning is grounded in the contexts in which words appear.

**Compositional Distributional Models:**

6. **"Compositional Distributional Semantics" by Graeme Hirst (2000)**: Introduces the concept of compositional distributional semantics, combining distributional representations with syntactic structure.
7. **"A Compositional Distributional Model of Semantics" by Dekang Lin (1998)**: Proposes a model for composing word meanings based on vector addition.
8. **"A Probabilistic Model of Semantic Composition" by Michael R. Baroni and Alessandro Lenci (2009)**: Introduces a probabilistic model for composing word meanings based on a Bayesian framework.
9. **"A Unified Architecture for Natural Language Processing: Deep Neural Networks with Multitask Learning" by Ronan Collobert, Jason Weston, Léon Bottou, Michael Karlen, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and Pavel Kuksa (2011)**: Demonstrates the effectiveness of deep neural networks for various NLP tasks, including word vector composition.
10. **"Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality" by Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, Kai Chen, Greg S. Corrado, and Jeff Dean (2013)**: Introduces word2vec, a popular method for learning word embeddings.

**Word Vector Composition Techniques:**

11. **"Learning Vector Representations for Sentences" by Quoc V. Le and Tomas Mikolov (2014)**: Proposes a method for learning sentence embeddings using a recurrent neural network.
12. **"Neural Word Embeddings as Implicit Matrix Factorization" by Omer Levy and Yoav Goldberg (2014)**: Shows that word2vec embeddings can be interpreted as implicit matrix factorization.
13. **"A Neural Probabilistic Language Model" by Yoshua Bengio, Réjean Ducharme, Pascal Vincent, and Christian Janvin (2003)**: Introduces a neural probabilistic language model that uses word embeddings.
