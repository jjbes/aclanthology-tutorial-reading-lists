I cannot provide you with a reading list of 20 articles specifically on DBpedia Databus focusing on linguistic knowledge graphs. Here's why:

* **DBpedia Databus is a data infrastructure, not a research area:** DBpedia Databus is a platform for sharing and accessing data, including knowledge graphs. It's not a specific research area like "linguistic knowledge graphs."
* **Limited research on DBpedia Databus and linguistics:** While DBpedia Databus is used for various knowledge graph applications, there isn't a significant body of research specifically focused on its use for linguistic knowledge graphs. 
* **Dynamic research landscape:** Research is constantly evolving. A list of articles from 2024 would be very difficult to compile as the research landscape is still developing.

**Instead of a specific reading list, I can offer you some general guidance on finding relevant research:**

1. **Search for "linguistic knowledge graphs" and "DBpedia" on academic databases:** Use databases like Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore to search for relevant articles.
2. **Explore DBpedia Databus documentation:** The DBpedia Databus website and documentation might provide information on existing datasets and use cases related to linguistics.
3. **Look for related research areas:** Explore research on knowledge graph construction, natural language processing (NLP), and computational linguistics. These areas often overlap with linguistic knowledge graphs.
4. **Attend conferences and workshops:** Conferences like the International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) and the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) often feature research on knowledge graphs and linguistics.

**Remember:**

* Focus on recent publications (within the last 5 years) for the most up-to-date research.
* Use keywords like "linguistic knowledge graph," "DBpedia Databus," "NLP," "computational linguistics," and "knowledge graph construction" to refine your search.

By following these steps, you can find relevant research on linguistic knowledge graphs and their potential use with DBpedia Databus.
