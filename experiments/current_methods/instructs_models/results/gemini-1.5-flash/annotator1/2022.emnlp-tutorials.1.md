2. **Dowty, D. R. (1979). Word meaning and Montague grammar: The semantics of verbs and times in generative semantics and in Montague's PTQ.** - Explores the relationship between word meaning and formal semantics.
3. **Karttunen, L. (1973). Presuppositions of compound sentences.** - Discusses the role of presuppositions in sentence meaning.
4. **Heim, I. (1982). The semantics of definite and indefinite noun phrases.** - Examines the semantics of noun phrases and their role in meaning representation.
5. **Parsons, T. (1990). Events in the semantics of English: A study in subatomic semantics.** - Introduces the notion of events as fundamental units of meaning.

**Computational Approaches:**

6. **Jurafsky, D., & Martin, J. H. (2000). Speech and language processing: An introduction to natural language processing, computational linguistics, and speech recognition.** - A comprehensive introduction to computational linguistics, including meaning representation.
7. **Allen, J. (1995). Natural language understanding.** - Covers various aspects of natural language understanding, including meaning representation.
8. **Barwise, J., & Perry, J. (1983). Situations and attitudes.** - Introduces situation semantics, a framework for representing meaning based on situations and their properties.
9. **Hobbs, J. R. (1985). Ontological promiscuity.** - Discusses the challenges of representing meaning in a way that is flexible and adaptable to different domains.
10. **McCawley, J. D. (1979). Everything that linguists have always known about syntax is wrong.** - A critical analysis of traditional syntactic theories and their limitations in capturing meaning.

**Recent Advancements:**

11. **Bender, E. M. (2003). Linguistic typology and semantic universals.** - Explores the relationship between linguistic typology and semantic universals.
12. **Jackendoff, R. (2002). Foundations of language: Brain, meaning, grammar, evolution.** - Examines the cognitive foundations of language and meaning representation.
13. **Talmy, L. (2000). Toward a cognitive semantics.** - Introduces cognitive semantics, a framework that emphasizes the role of human cognition in meaning representation.
14. **Pustejovsky, J. (1995). The generative lexicon.** - Presents a theory of lexical semantics that emphasizes the role of generative processes in meaning representation.
15. **Nunberg, G. (1995). Transfers of meaning.** - Explores the phenomenon of meaning transfer and its implications for meaning representation.

**Applications:**

16. **Hovy, E. H. (2003). Automated text summarization.** - Discusses the role of meaning representation in automated text summarization.
17. **Manning, C. D., & Sch√ºtze, H. (1999). Foundations of statistical natural language processing.** - Introduces statistical methods for natural language processing, including meaning representation.
18. **Sowa, J. F. (2000). Knowledge representation: Logical, philosophical, and computational foundations.** - Explores the use of knowledge representation techniques for representing meaning.
