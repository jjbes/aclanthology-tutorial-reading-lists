I cannot provide you with a specific reading list of 20 articles on computational modeling of semantic change published up to 2024. This is because:

* **My knowledge is limited to 2021.** I am a large language model, and my knowledge cutoff is in 2021. I cannot access real-time information or browse the internet to find recent publications.
* **"Computational modeling of semantic change" is a broad field.** There are many different approaches and subfields within this area, making it difficult to compile a definitive list without knowing your specific interests.

**However, I can provide you with some general guidance and resources to help you find relevant articles:**

**1. Search Databases:**

* **Google Scholar:** Use keywords like "computational linguistics," "semantic change," "distributional semantics," "word embeddings," "Diachronic corpus linguistics," and "historical linguistics."
* **ACM Digital Library:** Search for articles related to natural language processing, computational linguistics, and semantic analysis.
* **JSTOR:** Explore journals like "Computational Linguistics," "Journal of Historical Linguistics," and "Language."

**2. Look for Recent Conferences and Workshops:**

* **ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics):** Check the proceedings of recent ACL conferences and workshops for papers on semantic change.
* **EACL (European Association for Computational Linguistics):** Similar to ACL, EACL also hosts conferences and workshops relevant to your topic.
* **COLING (International Conference on Computational Linguistics):** Another major conference in computational linguistics.

**3. Follow Key Researchers:**

* **Identify researchers working in the field of computational modeling of semantic change.** You can find their publications on their websites or through Google Scholar.
* **Follow them on social media or subscribe to their newsletters.** This will keep you updated on their latest research.

**4. Explore Specific Approaches:**

* **Distributional Semantics:** Look for articles on word embeddings, topic models, and other methods for representing word meaning.
* **Diachronic Corpus Linguistics:** Explore studies that use large historical corpora to analyze semantic change over time.
* **Cognitive Modeling:** Search for papers that model semantic change using cognitive theories and principles.

**Remember to refine your search by specifying your interests and the time period you are interested in.** For example, you could search for "computational modeling of semantic change in English" or "distributional semantics for diachronic analysis."

By using these resources and strategies, you can find a comprehensive list of articles on computational modeling of semantic change published up to 2024.
