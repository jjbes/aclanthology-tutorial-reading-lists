Creating a reading list for articles that will be published before 2025 is a bit challenging since it involves predicting future publications. However, I can provide a list of seminal and recent articles up to 2023 that are highly relevant to the topic of contextualizing language with humans, groups, and communities for socially aware NLP. These articles can serve as a strong foundation and guide you towards future research in this area.
