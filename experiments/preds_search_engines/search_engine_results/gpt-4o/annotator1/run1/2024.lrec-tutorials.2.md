Creating a reading list of 20 articles specifically about the geo- and socio-cultural identity in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) up to 2024 is a bit challenging, as this is a highly specialized and emerging field. However, I can provide a list of articles and papers that touch on related themes such as the cultural implications of AI, biases in machine learning, and the integration of human feedback in reinforcement learning. This should give you a comprehensive understanding of the broader context and emerging discussions in this area.
