Please note that some of the titles in this list are repetitive and may not represent actual distinct articles. This is a common issue when generating lists based on patterns. For a more accurate and diverse list, I recommend checking academic databases like Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, or the ACL Anthology for the latest and most relevant research articles in the field of end-to-end speech translation.
