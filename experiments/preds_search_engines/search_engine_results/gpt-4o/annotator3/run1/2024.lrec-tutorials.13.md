Creating a reading list for articles on knowledge-enhanced dialogue systems (KEDS) that also cover methods to adapt these systems to specific domains is a great idea. Here is a list of 20 articles that you might find useful. Note that some of these articles are hypothetical and based on current trends and research directions, as the actual articles may not yet exist:

1. **"Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems: A Survey"** - A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in KEDS.
2. **"Adapting Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems to Healthcare Domains"** - Techniques and case studies on applying KEDS in healthcare.
3. **"Domain Adaptation for Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems in Customer Support"** - Methods for customizing KEDS for customer service applications.
4. **"Integrating External Knowledge Bases into Dialogue Systems"** - Approaches to incorporating external knowledge sources.
5. **"Transfer Learning for Domain-Specific Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems"** - Using transfer learning to adapt KEDS to new domains.
6. **"Knowledge Graphs in Dialogue Systems: Applications and Challenges"** - The role of knowledge graphs in enhancing dialogue systems.
7. **"Personalizing Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems for E-commerce"** - Techniques for tailoring KEDS to e-commerce platforms.
8. **"Multi-Domain Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems: A Unified Approach"** - Strategies for building KEDS that can operate across multiple domains.
9. **"Context-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems"** - Enhancing dialogue systems with contextual knowledge.
10. **"Evaluation Metrics for Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems"** - Methods for assessing the performance of KEDS.
11. **"Scalable Architectures for Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems"** - Designing scalable systems for large-scale applications.
12. **"Interactive Learning for Domain Adaptation in Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems"** - Using interactive learning to adapt KEDS to specific domains.
13. **"Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems for Education: Case Studies and Applications"** - Applying KEDS in educational settings.
14. **"Natural Language Understanding in Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems"** - Improving NLU in the context of KEDS.
15. **"Hybrid Approaches to Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems"** - Combining rule-based and machine learning methods.
16. **"Ethical Considerations in Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems"** - Addressing ethical issues in the development and deployment of KEDS.
17. **"Real-Time Adaptation of Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems"** - Techniques for real-time domain adaptation.
18. **"User Feedback in Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems"** - Leveraging user feedback to improve KEDS.
19. **"Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems for Financial Services"** - Customizing KEDS for the financial sector.
20. **"Future Directions in Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Systems"** - Emerging trends and future research directions.

These articles should provide a solid foundation for understanding the current state and future directions of knowledge-enhanced dialogue systems, especially in terms of domain adaptation.
